<h1>Welcome to My Site!</h1>
<p> Hey, I’m Praneesh! I’m a second-year CSE student from Coimbatore diving deep into the world of Blockchain Technology. My coding toolkit includes Python, Java, and C/C++, and I enjoy grinding through Data Structures and Algorithms problems to sharpen my logic. I’m the kind of person who is always curious—whether it’s mastering a new language or exploring the latest tech trends. I love the process of learning and am always looking for the next interesting challenge to tackle.</p>
